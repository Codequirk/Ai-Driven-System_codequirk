# Ai-Driven-System_codequirk
ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project is an AI-powered system that allows users to query weather data using natural language (NL) queries. It dynamically selects relevant data from a JSON-based weather dataset and filters the most relevant results using NLP techniques (spaCy).

The system understands and processes queries like:
âœ” "What is the temperature today?"
âœ” "Will it rain tomorrow?"
âœ” "What was the humidity in Bangalore yesterday?"
It then retrieves and displays the most relevant weather information from the dataset.

This AI-powered system dynamically selects relevant weather data from a **JSON dataset** based on **natural language queries** using **spaCy** for NLP.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
âœ… **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for weather-related queries  
âœ… **Automatic table selection** based on query keywords  
âœ… **Intelligent filtering** to find the most relevant weather data  
âœ… **Supports date-based queries** (e.g., "What's the temperature today?")  
âœ… **Lightweight & Fast** (Uses JSON instead of a database)
